# About me

My name is Julien Dessaux and Adyxax is my nickname. I am a 40 years old guy
working in a DevOps role. You can read more about me [on my
website](https://www.adyxax.org/docs/about-me).

I only keep a very small showcase presence on GitHub nowadays. If you want to
see what I am up to, head over to [my forgejo
instance](https://git.adyxax.org/adyxax).
